## PROBLEM STATEMENT : HIRING SOLUTION 
Develop a Hiring Solution that automates The Hiring Process tasks and provides insights into employee performance and engagement. A hiring solution hackathon problem typically involves developing new technologies or business models that can improve the recruitment and hiring process. Participants are challenged to create solutions that can streamline the hiring process for both employers and candidates, reduce bias, and improve the candidate experience. Problem statements may include developing features such as intelligent resume screening tools, gamification of the hiring process, candidate skill assessments, and diversity and inclusion features. The ultimate goal is to create a hiring solution that is efficient, effective, and fair for both employers and candidates.
